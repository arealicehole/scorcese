REPL utility

The SDK provides run_demo_loop for quick, interactive testing of an agent's behavior directly in your terminal.

import asyncio
from agents import Agent, run_demo_loop

async def main() -> None:
    
agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="You are a helpful assistant.")
    
await run_demo_loop(agent)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    
asyncio.run(main())

run_demo_loop prompts for user input in a loop, keeping the conversation history between turns. By default, it streams model output as it is produced. When you run the example above, run_demo_loop starts an interactive chat session. It continuously asks for your input, remembers the entire conversation history between turns (so your agent knows what's been discussed) and automatically streams the agent's responses to you in real-time as they are generated.

To end this chat session, simply type quit or exit (and press Enter) or use the Ctrl-D keyboard shortcut.

run_demo_loop(
    
agent: Agent[Any],
    
*,
    
stream: bool = True,
    
context: TContext | None = None,
) -> None

Run a simple REPL loop with the given agent.

This utility allows quick manual testing and debugging of an agent from the command line. Conversation state is preserved across turns. Enter exit or quit to stop the loop.
